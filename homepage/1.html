            Let's say someone was discussing New York City in a conversation. What is the first thing that comes to mind when hearing that place? It could be people just walking down the street or talking with friends and families. It could also be about Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, or Staten Island; but I think we shall further go into New York City. Whenever New York City pops into my mind, I think about the people joyfully walking down the street, driving through the bumpy road, eating the most classic foods, and learning in tutoring places where it can teach you good education. Any place in New York City should have a meaning to who you are, and where you would consider it as home. I personally think that this can be all referenced to the one and only place in Queens, Flushing. In Flushing, New Yorkers can experience the adventure of a lifetime through the diversity of each person with their excitement, the outstanding quality of the variety of Asian foods, and the hometown of the jovial and amusing Chinese people due to varieties.

            Flushing is New York City’s largest Chinatown and home of immigrants, composed mostly of Chinese and Koreans, and one of the trendiest and coolest spots where Asians go through and do a lot of cool activities. One is during Chinese New Year, there is usually a parade to celebrate the Lunar New Year. I usually go by it whenever I go through Flushing to tutoring, and it was pretty cool with the booming drums and pretty rainbow loins. Another is their study of religion whether it is Confucianism or Buddhism. These religions can be practiced in Flushing; and in fact, there is a temple called Han Ma Um Zen Center, and they usually have ceremonies to follow the traditions. Flushing is also known for the variety of authentic food you can eat there. What I mean about variety is basically different regions of China coming together like Sichuan, Hunan, Beijing, Fujian, and Canton. There is usually food like dumplings, noodles, dimsum, hot pot, roasted pork or duck, bubble tea, pastries from a bakery(usually from Hong Kong), and stir fry. A popular place is the New World Mall where they have a food court and the variety is endless. One shop I usually order is the MaLa Tang where they serve spicy dry pot similar to a stir fry stew with a lot of different vegetables and meats.

            I started my journey in Flushing the minute I came from the underground of Flushing-Main Street Station on the 7 line. I was going to a tutoring place called Mega Academy in the beginning of 3rd grade, and I felt pretty apathetic because I didn’t know anyone and would rather go home. The teachers were mostly Chinese people and usually very strict, which is also a reason why I didn’t want to experience the pain. But as time gradually went further,  I started to actually like learning new things and began to study the ones I enjoy the most. I also had some new friends and began to hangout with them. Those friends and I went to other tutoring places around Flushing and began helping each other to grow as a human being. All of this continued till the present today. I am still having tutoring classes in Flushing like AMC12, AP Calculus, AP Physics, and Java. I realized that the joy of learning and having those that help makes me want to stay at Flushing forever.

            Flushing is a place that I feel has more character and culture compared to other places. As I said before, Flushing is a place where the immigrants came from different regions of China, and each of the different regions have their own culture and profile. So when coming to Flushing, there is a unification of people and culture. I feel this unification amplifies each people’s feelings more than any other places. For example, in Time Square, I feel that it is just a classical place where people walk down and there isn’t a variety of places that demonstrate any culture or variety. I’m sorry to say this, but my sensation towards other places felt pretty boring or dull. It is almost as if someone made a dinner without any spirit and ended up making a mediocre TV dinner with no flavor. I feel that in Flushing, being driven into a corner is exactly what we want! The chance to bring forth unimaginable power like courage, friendship, love, knowledge, sincerity, reliability, and hope! This can bring the community together and make us better and better for the rest of our lives.
